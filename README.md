# action-vercel-pagesã€€(WIP)

## Workflow for Deployment to Vercel

The concept is similar to using actions to create a `gh-pages` branch for deployment. Here, actions are used to create a `vercel` branch, which is then set as the production branch in Vercel settings to enable a comparable operational setup.

## Workflow Steps
1. Organize files in actions based on the contents listed in `.vercelkeep`. The patterns are as follows:
   - Files that are in Git and also in `.vercelkeep`   
   ã€€â†’ **Keep as Git-managed files**.
   - Files not in Git but listed in `.vercelkeep` (e.g., files generated during the build process)  
   ã€€â†’ **Add to Git as target files for the next step into the `vercel` branch**.  
   - Files in Git but not in `.vercelkeep`  
   ã€€â†’ **Remove from Git and delete them** (to avoid cluttering Vercel with unnecessary files).

2. Commit and push changes to the `vercel` branch.

## Post-Setup
1. For the first time setup, update the settings in Vercel under **Settings > Environments > Production** and set the **Branch Tracking** to `vercel`.

2. Optionally, you can add the following configuration to prevent builds from running on branches other than `vercel`. For the GUI, this can be achieved under **Settings > Git** in the **Ignored Build Step**. (This is not directly related to the workflow and is optional.)

    if [[ "$VERCEL_GIT_COMMIT_REF" == "vercel" && "$VERCEL_ENV" == "production" ]] ; then
       # Proceed with the build
       echo "âœ… - Build can proceed"
       exit 1;
    else
       # Don't build
       echo "ðŸ›‘ - Build cancelled"
       exit 0;
    fi
